Current Version: 4.0.6

Version 4.0.6
- new cWidgetRoot.Windowless-Property
- new cWidgetBase.ToolTipDuration-Property
- new Class cWebArchive (a File- and InMemory-Archiver, which can load
  its Content also from Resources)

Version 4.0.5
- fixed cWidgetForm.Load, which didn't behave exactly right in conjunction with
  cWidgetForm.Show
- new Method on cFSO (cFSO.IsFileWritable)
- new Method on cThreadHandler (cThreadHandler.WaitForEmptyJobQueue)
- new Version of vb_cairo_sqlite.dll (SQLite now again at recent version 3.7.14)

Version 4.0.4
- fixed TimeOut of 1.3sec whilst opening SQLite-Files on ReadOnly-Folders 
  (or if the File itself got the ReadOnly-Attribute - using sqlite3_open_v2)
- changed the chinese Default-Fallback-Font to the better matching "SimSun"
  in case of "mixed Unicode-TextOutput" (thanks to Boxian Zhou, for pointing that out)

Version 4.0.3
- bugfix in cTCPServer.SendData (in case the connection was reset by 
  the remote side) thanks to Wolfgang Wolf for catching that 
- Added a new EnumValue for the first Param in cWidgetForms.Create
  (Value 6 now ensures Borderless-Alpha-Windows, which behave similar
  to PopUps, but do have a TaskBar-Entry and are not "TopMost"

Version 4.0.2 
- companion Dll vb_cairo_sqlite now includes latest SQLite 3.7.10 -
  also fixed the contained chipmunk-based static-lib, so that it
  doesn't depend on SSE2 capable CPUs anymore
- fixed a Bug in cWidgetForms, when created on a separate Thread
  (They need GetDeskTopWindow as a Parent then)
- Workaround for missing RealmName-Prop in cWebResponse (now it's
  possible to use: cWebResponse.ServerName = "ServerName (RealmName)"

Version 4.0.1
- stabilized the cWidgetForms-engine for Debugging-Safety
- did the same enhancements also in cSubClass
- Fixes/Performance-Enhancements in the Widget-Rendering-Stack
- cFSO.ReadByteContent/ReadTextContent was fixed, to also give correct
  results on existing Files with no content (an empty ByteArray or String)
- Rs.UpdateBatch Fix, when working against an "attached Table" (when said
  table was similarly named to an already existing table in the main-DB)
